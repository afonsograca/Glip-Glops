# Glip Glops
Glip Glops is a color theme. It’s like *Xcode*’s **Civic** and **Dusk**  themes had a baby and it was raised by all the other languages you love to code in.

So basically it’s supposed to run pretty much everywhere, bringing you the immense joy of having a unified look throughout your everyday tools.
